## Overview

This is a simple To-Do application built using React Native. It includes fundamental features such as state management, UI components, and basic navigation. 

## Features

1. **Add New Task**: 
   - Users can add a new task using a text input field and an "Add Task" button.

2. **Display Tasks**: 
   - The list of added tasks is displayed in a scrollable view.

3. **Task Completion**: 
   - Users can mark a task as completed by tapping on it, which adds a strike-through effect for completed tasks.

4. **Delete Task**: 
   - Each task has a "Delete" button/icon to remove it from the list.

5. **Navigation**: 
   - Two screens:
     - **Home Screen**: Displays the to-do list.
     - **Details Screen**: Shows the details of a selected task (task name and completion status).

6. **State Management**: 
   - Uses Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state efficiently.

7. **UI/UX**: 
   - Basic styling includes colors, padding, and font sizes for a visually appealing interface.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- **Local Persistence**: Tasks are persisted locally using AsyncStorage.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents empty tasks from being added.
